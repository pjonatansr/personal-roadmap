#### Disclaimer: Repository Under Construction.

## Introduction
This repository's is just for studing purposes. Some concepts may be new for me, therefore, if you're learning some content and got here I must say that you shouldn't use this repository as your unique source of knowledge, but if you has doubts about the content which is covered here or know something that can improve anything here, please let me know.

Everytime that I want to study a new content, being about soft or hard skills, I will propose me to generate a asset, that can be an article or code, because I want to store here my new acquired knowledge, that way I can improve my code skills, build a portfolio and share it back to the comunnity. 

I will publish here all my progress, starting from a basic and rustic code for improve over the 2022 year, according by my studies.

## Current Learning
For the begin I will do two basic Node.Js APIs and connect each to a different database with the intention of reaching the architecture below then I will decide which message broker I want to focus on and then I will start the next.js client development.

Btw, for now I'll just easy, step-by-step, the first focus will be on the first API, "Article-Writer-API" with Node, Koa and Mongo.

## Previous Learning
Before the 1st step with the Article-Writer-API I wanted to remember the basics about node, mongo and express because had some time since the last time that I used to programming in NodeJs.

I did choose to begin a free course from freecodecamp.com, named "[Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)" and started my learning with [replit](http://replit.com/). Here are the repositories that I forked and solved the three first modules and now I need to work only in the microservices:

- [x] [Managing Packages with NPM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#managing-packages-with-npm): [boilerplate-npm](https://github.com/pjonatansr/boilerplate-npm)

- [x] [Basic Node and Express](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#basic-node-and-express): [boilerplate-express](https://github.com/pjonatansr/boilerplate-express)

- [x] [MongoDB and Mongoose](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#mongodb-and-mongoose): [boilerplate-mongomongoose](https://github.com/pjonatansr/boilerplate-mongomongoose)

- [ ] [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)
- [ ] [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)
- [ ] [Url Shortner Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
- [ ] [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker)
- [ ] [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice)
