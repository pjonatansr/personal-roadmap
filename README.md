#### Disclaimer: Repository Under Construction.

## Introduction
This repository is just for studying purposes. Some concepts may be new for me, therefore, if you're here for some content I must say that you shouldn't use this repository as your unique source of knowledge. 
If do you have doubts about the content which is covered here or know something that can improve anything here, please let me know.

Every time that I want to study a new content, being about soft or hard skills, I will propose me to generate an asset, that can be an article or code. This is because I want to store here my new acquired knowledge, that way I can improve my code skills, build a portfolio and share it back to the community. 

I will publish here all my progress, starting from a basic and rustic code to improve over 2022, according to my studies.

## Current Learning
Blockchain course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/formacao-engenheiro-de-blockchain/). Code [here](https://github.com/pjonatansr/blockchain_course).

## Previous Learning
Before the 1st step with the Article-Writer-API I wanted to remember the basics about NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express because had some time since the last time that I used to programming in NodeJS.

I did choose to begin a free course from freecodecamp.com, named "[Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)" and started my learning with [Replit](http://replit.com/). Here are the repositories that I forked and solved the three first modules, and now I need to work only in the microservices:

## Main Objective
(Not working on it now)
I will do two basic NodeJS APIs and connect each to a different database, with the intention of reaching the architecture below.
Then I will decide which message broker I want to focus on.
And then I will start the next.js client development.

BTW, for now I'll just easy, step-by-step, the first focus will be on the first API, “Article-Writer-API” with Node, Koa and MongoDB.
